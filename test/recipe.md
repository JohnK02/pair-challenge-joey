## 1. user story
As a user
So that I can keep --track of my music listening # initialise empty list
I want to --add tracks #function_name I've listened to and --see a list of them. #return a list

## 2. Design the class

```python

class MusicTracker:
    # User-facing properties:
    #   list of the tracks
    pass

    def __init__(self):
        # Parameters:
        #   None
        # Returns:
        #   None
        # Side effects:
        #   initialise empty list called tracks
        pass

    def add_tracks(self, track):
        # Parameters:
        #   track - a string
        # Returns:
        #   None
        # Side effects:
        #   add track to list called tracks
        pass

    def list_tracks(self):
        # Parameters:
        #   None
        # Returns:
        #   list called tracks
        # Side effects:
        #   None
        pass

```
